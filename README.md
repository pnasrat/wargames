Just for personal fun/learning

This is a simple project working towards tictactoe (or Noughts and Crosses in en_GB).

# Installation

This is a standard go repository - use `go get` see https://golang.org/doc/articles/go_command.html#tmp_3

# Notes

This is pretty minimal right now and not complete - but hopefully enough to get started/refactor into something interesting.
